# ARController


TODO list

need for selection disambiguation? Zoom in?

TO IMPLEMENT
- on/off surface constraints button (for spheres sculptures)
- hide object manipulation menu until object is selected?
- orientation and position constraints for lego like scene? Make it easier to build, but the technique becomes less general
- user 2 mode (block some commands and degrees of freedom?)
- center button to return selection to the center of the screen? (I lost objects a couple of times)
- unselect all objects button?
- synchrony of group materials
- add a table surface



KNOWN ISSUES
- Translation update only after the touch is finished in the client
- Lock button does not work
